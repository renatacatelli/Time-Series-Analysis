# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository contains code and data analysis related to predicting the total number of orders in an online retail environment. Throughout this project:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I performed detailed EDA to understand the complexities of sales metrics and visualized key trends.

Time Series Decomposition: I implemented seasonal decomposition techniques to separate the time series into key components.

ARIMA Modeling: I used an ARIMA model to make future forecasts of the total number of orders.
